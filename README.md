## Introduction

This repository is holding the Testnet branch of the main ARI repository. This branch is utilized specifically for the Testnet setup.
It's the implementation of a full Node with a JSON-REST HTTP interface (API).
It's based upon Java 8 and therefore a requirement.

## TESTNET What is this repository about?

The Testnet is used to thoroughly review and verify new functions and also to offer an non-critical environment for testing.
It's can also be used to get a start on implementing various integrations for Aidos Kuneen.
The `minWeightMagnitude` is reduced from `18` to `13`, therefore the Proof of Work is completed much faster in this environment.
The Install/Build process is pretty much the same as for the normal ARI.  
To be safe and don't confuse things with the Mainnet the databases for the Testnet have a different file ending (`*.store.testnet`).  
The Testnet API runs on port `15555` by default and the ARI won't allow you to use the same default Meshport (`14265`) as in the ARI Mainnet.

## Install

1. You can either download a build version from the [Release Page](https://github.com/AidosKuneen/aidos-node/releases) or build by yourself by following the instructions hereafter.

2. Get [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

3. Clone this repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AidosKuneen/aidos-node
  ```
  
4. Switch to the Testnet branch:

  ```
  git checkout testnet
  ```
  
## How To Build

Maven is needed in order to compile and build the ARI.

* To compile:

```
$ mvn clean compile
```

* To create an executable build.

```
$ mvn package
```

Creating an executable build generates an executable jar package called "ari-${release-version}.jar" in the root directory of the project.

## How To Execute

```
java -jar ari-${version}.jar [{-r,--receiver-port} 15777] [{-p,--peer-discovery}] [{-w,--remote-wallet}] [{--testnet}] [{-l,--local} ipv4/ipv6][{-c,--enabled-cors} *] [{-d,--debug}] [{-e,--experimental}]
```
				
The following argument is mandatory to start a Node:  
* `-r` or `--receiver-port` define the Mesh port

Also you have to either select  
* `-p` or `--peer-discovery` enables the API for remote access (will only enable commands that are necessary for peer discovery)
* `-w` or `--remote-wallet` enable the node for remote access and limit the API to commands that are needed for enabling light wallet access (including peer discovery)  

to enable and get access to peer discovery.

The following parameters are optional:

* `--testnet` to launch on the ARI Testnet

* `-l` or `--local ipv4/ipv6` , to select which ip address the node should be reachable on. Without this argument the ip address is selected automatically. This parameter is mostly helpful if you have multiple interfaces or if you want to run a node on DS-Lite to specify your ipv6

* `-c` or `--enabled-cors` enable the API cross origin filter: cors domain defined between ''

* `-d` or `--debug` prints on the standard output, more debug informations

* `-e` or `--experimental` activates experimental features.

* `-h` prints the usage
 

For instance a valid call would be:

```
java -jar target/ari-1.0.1.0.jar -r 15777 -p --testnet
```

Note that the Testnet API runs on port 15555 by default.
